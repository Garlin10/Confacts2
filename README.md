The FIWARE-based framework is designed to address specific challenges and facilitate efficient development using the FIWARE ecosystem. It consists of two major components:

### Data Collector and Uploader

The data collector and uploader component allow seamless integration with various data sources and are responsible for collecting and uploading data to the FIWARE platform. This component simplifies the process of data ingestion and ensures smooth data flow.

### IDS Agent

The IDS Agent is the second major component of the framework. This component plays a vital role getting data and updating it to FIWARE from Inesc Tec IDS solution.

## FIWARE Image

The FIWARE Docker image included in this repository allows you to deploy and run FIWARE easily. It contains all the necessary dependencies and configurations to set up a functional FIWARE instance effortlessly.
