    <h1>Project Name</h1>
    <p>This repository contains a FIWARE Docker image and a FIWARE-based framework.</p>

    <h2>FIWARE-Based Framework</h2>
    <p>
        The FIWARE-based framework is designed to address specific challenges and facilitate efficient development
        using the FIWARE ecosystem. It consists of two major components:
    </p>

    <h3>Data Collector and Uploader</h3>
    <p>
        The data collector and uploader component allows seamless integration with various data sources and is
        responsible for collecting and uploading data to the FIWARE platform. This component simplifies the process of
        data ingestion and ensures smooth data flow.
    </p>

    <h3>IDS Agent</h3>
    <p>
        The IDS Agent is the second major component of the framework. It provides functionalities related to Identity
        Management and Access Control within the FIWARE ecosystem. This component plays a vital role in securing data
        and controlling access to various services.
    </p>
