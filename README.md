# Confacts 2 FIWARE Framework for IDS system

This repository contains a FIWARE Docker image and a FIWARE-based framework for IDS system provided by [Inesc Tec](https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/ids/dataspace-4confacts).

## FIWARE-Based Framework

The FIWARE-based framework is designed to address specific challenges and facilitate efficient development using the FIWARE ecosystem. It consists of two major components:

### Data Collector and Uploader

The data collector and uploader component allow seamless integration with various data sources and are responsible for collecting and uploading data to the FIWARE platform. This component simplifies the process of data ingestion and ensures smooth data flow.

### IDS Agent

The IDS Agent is the second major component of the framework. It provides functionalities related to Identity Management and Access Control within the FIWARE ecosystem. This component plays a vital role in securing data and controlling access to various services.

## FIWARE Image

The FIWARE Docker image included in this repository allows you to deploy and run FIWARE easily. It contains all the necessary dependencies and configurations to set up a functional FIWARE instance effortlessly.
